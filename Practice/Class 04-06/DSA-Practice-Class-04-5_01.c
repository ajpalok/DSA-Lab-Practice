// *** Write a function to detect if a singly linked list has a cycle.
// *** Create a function to merge two sorted singly linked lists into one sorted linked list.
// Implement a function to remove duplicates from an unsorted singly linked list.
// Write a function to add two numbers represented by two linked lists (each node contains a single digit) and return the sum as a linked list.
// Create a function to partition a linked list around a given value, such that all nodes less than the value come before all nodes greater than or equal to the value.
// Implement a function to check if two singly linked lists intersect, and if they do, return the intersecting node.
